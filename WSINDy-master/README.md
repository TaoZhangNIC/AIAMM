For Paper, "Weak SINDy: Galerkin-based Data-Driven Model Selection";
by D. A. Messenger and D. M. Bortz;

master script: WSINDy_AG_script, demonstrates WSINDy on 6 ODE systems: 
{'Linear','Logistic_Growth','Van_der_Pol','Duffing','Lotka_Volterra','Lorenz'};

for use in MATLAB desktop version. User specifies the ODE system, tolerance for ODE solver, and signal-to-noise ratio. Error in weight recovery outputs to command window along with comparison to SINDy
